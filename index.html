                <p class="text-muted text-left">The pre-primary kids are more often here. They love to swing. Sometimes, all the rides are empty but kids are making lines just for the swing! We like it here. If our bus gets delayed or our parents haven't come, we can use this. Students who have graduated can also come here to see their school. It is a nice place to have fun or to talk to your friends about doubts. Even teachers come here to sit and revise what they will teach. In summer time, many students come here to shout and say to the school building, "See you after a month!" It is so loud, even the pigeons near our ground fly away. On Makar Sakranti, you can come here to prepare your kites for the kite-flying event which happens every year in our school.</p>

Higher-grade students learn to spin balls and move them swiftly. We learn to build our stamina to quickly pass the ball to somebody else. The pre-primary students run as fast as they can and learn to use hula-hoops. It's a very lively place. It is active almost everyday, except weekends of course.It is a nice change of scenery from the classrooms You can also see the sunrise there, which is if you wake up at the school at 5:35!! ;P</p>

It is a place where the principal sir tells us about the upcoming events and/or holidays. Many challenges are also conducted in the auditorium too, like the Underwater GK quiz which happened last year. They also show videos to pre-primary kids on the projector about life-lessons or why festivals are celebrated. Medals are also given to higher-students here. We also have dance celebrations and competitions there. Feels good to dance and sing on some beats there! Laboratory students are given awards for their sincerity here also.</p>

                        Our school has recently found a new way for us to submit our books. We have to write the uploaded notes and a parent of ours has to go to the school to drop it so that it can be officially stamped. Incase our parents are out of station we can send PDFs of the child's books.

* Wearing school uniform for lectures

* Punctuality 

* Self-disciplined 

* Diligent

* Active participation in classroom and co-curricular activities.                                                                                     
                            This is a really great way to encourage the students to follow these prompts.
